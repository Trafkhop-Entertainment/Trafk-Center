            <h1>What games we want to create</h1>
            <p>
              We want to create many things, but most importantly video games. We want to create a wide variety of games including many RPGs inspired by Mario&Luigi and Chrono Trigger with experimental game design, a fun racer with controls mixed from Super Mario Kart / Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and new creative gameplay innovations, a collectathon with a unique story and a cute protagonist, and a party game with fun minigames as well as many other classic board and card games.

            <h1>Why we are different</h1>
            <p>
              We focus on a consistent and rich lore that surpasses most others in consistency, uniqueness, and logic. The lore has many formulas that ensure consistency and logic. It has a complete and fully unique magic system with many formulas that make it possible to create your own spells with just a little bit of logic. We also focus on building in many aspects of real-life physics and understanding of the universe to make it even more different from other common systems. We also kinda focus on good graphics in the style of anime and music in the styles of Austrian, classical, internet, and Japanese music.

            <h1>What we are doing right now</h1>
            <p>
              We are currently still in the lore-writing phase, which will take more than a year to complete. After that, we will start developing said games, unless we still have to learn the necessary tools for the intended workflow.
