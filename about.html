      <h1>Why we are different</h1>

        It has a complete and fully unique magic system with many formulars that makes it possible to create your own spells just with a little bit of logic.<br>
        We also focus to build in many aspects of real live physics and understanding of the universe to make it even more different from other common systems.</p>
      <h1>What we are doing right now</h1>
